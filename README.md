# Tidy Up

If you role play the game at all, you'll probably find yourself storing extra gear in the player's home(s).

The way I tend to do this is to pick different containers for different kinds of gear. Armour goes in this wardrobe, weapons in this chest, and so on.

Which works, up to a point, but is a massive pain in the backside to keep everything organised manually.

It would be nice if your housecarl or other companions could help out here. What the hell do they do all day anyway, whilst you're out risking life and limb to put food on the table. Time they started earning their keep...

With Tidy Up, they can. You can tell them where to store particular kinds of things, then give them a bunch of stuff, and ask them to put it away.

## How It Works

There are various possible ways that you could tell your companions what goes where.

I wanted it to be relatively simple to set up, and quite easy to reconfigure, but still immersive.

The solution that I've settled on is that you ask them to give you a "label" for each kind of gear. This is an item which is added to your inventory. You can think of it as an instruction saying, for example, "put my armour here".

You place these labels into containers. You can put them all in different containers, or put multiple labels in the same container - it's completely flexible.

When you ask a companion to tidy some stuff away, they just go around and place things where the labels are. Simple!
