# Tidy Up

If you role play the game at all, you'll probably find yourself storing extra gear in the player's home(s).

The way I tend to do this is to pick different containers for different kinds of gear. Armour goes in this wardrobe, weapons in this chest, and so on.

Which works, up to a point, but is a massive pain in the backside to keep everything organised manually.

It would be nice if your housecarl or other companions could help out here. What the hell do they do all day anyway, whilst you're out risking life and limb to put food on the table. Time they started earning their keep...

With Tidy Up, they can. You can tell them where to store particular kinds of things, then give them a bunch of stuff, and ask them to put it away.

## How It Works

When you're in a player home, a number of dialogue options are unlocked, under the general heading "We Should Tidy Up...". You can say these things to anyone else in the home.

To start off with, you ask them "Let Me Show You Where To Put Things".

They will then give you a number of "labels". These are notes, each of which represents a different category of item. You can think of one of these notes as an instruction saying, for example, "put my armour here".

You place these labels into containers. You can put them all in different containers, or put multiple labels in the same container - it's completely flexible.

When you ask a companion to tidy some stuff away, they just go around and place things where the labels are. Simple!


## Tidying Options

Currently there are only two options for what to tidy.

- you can give someone specific things to tidy
- you can ask them to tidy your spare gear

Only the first of these works reliably right now.

For the second option, the definition of "spare" is currently items that are not equipped and not marked favourite. This may be too narrow a definition, and I might need to come up with a way to customise it a bit more.


## What About Multiple Homes?

Right now, TidyUp is really optimised to work with a single home being the main base.

You can have as many homes as you like, and can scatter labels around the homes.

When you ask for something to be tidied, the tidier will put things wherever the label is, which means that you can theoretically abuse this system to teleport items to a different home.

Currently though you can only have a single label for each type of item, so unless you have a specific reason to do so, it doesn't make a lot of sense to have some labels in one home and some in another.


## Known Issues and Future Plans

There are some types of item that we don't have a label for.

There are some types of item (especially clothes and armour), that it would be better to have more specific labels for.

I hope to expand the range of labels in a future version.

As mentioned above, support for multiple homes is minimal. At some point I might make it so that tidying is restricted to labels that are in the home that you are standing in. This will probably also require adding the ability to obtain multiple copies of a label.

There are some item types that don't work so well with labels. It would be nice if things like Soul Gems got tidied into bowls, but you can't put a label into a bowl. I might add special-case support for this sort of thing later.

Currently you can't ask someone to tidy up their own spare gear. I plan to add this.

Other special-case things I'm thinking of adding are:

- options to have someone tidy loose clutter in the home (eg things that are just lying around
- options to collect things from the tidying locations
- options to have someone install tidied items into other locations in the house; for example, getting out the best weapons and putting them into weapon racks
